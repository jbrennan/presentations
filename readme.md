Presentations
=============

A repository to hold all my presentations I give. Each dated directory contains a presentation in PDF and Keynote format, along with a submodule link to any relevant code respositories, if applicable.

To use
------

Clone the repo, then initialize and recursively pull all the submodules.

If you like this idea
---------------------

I encourage you to do the same. It's nice to have your presentations all in one place, and even nicer to have links to the source code from those presentations. Everybody wins.
